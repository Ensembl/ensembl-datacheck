=head1 METHODS

=head2 name
  Description: Name of datacheck.
=cut
has 'name' => (
  is       => 'ro',
  isa      => 'Str',
  required => 1

=head2 description
  Description: Brief description of datacheck.
=cut
has 'description' => (
  is       => 'ro',
  isa      => 'Str',
  required => 1

=head2 groups
  Description: Datachecks belong to zero or more groups. These can be
               conceptual ('gene-related') or pragmatic (e.g. 'handover').

  Description: A datacheck can be "critical" (must not fail) or "advisory".

  is      => 'ro',
  isa     => enum(['critical', 'advisory']),

=head2 output
  Description: Once a datacheck has been run, TAP-formatted results are stored.
